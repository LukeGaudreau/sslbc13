### Voice mail help with Zotero
One fine day this past fall, I came back from lunch to find the VoiceMail indicator on phone lit up. On the other end was the voice a of a desparate student. She had a paper due tomorrow and she was having trouble getting all of her citations working through zotero. 

I arranged for her to come in that afternoon, and I set down to help her. We started by looking at the citations she had collected in Zotero. Her Zotero collection looked something like this:

### Look at citations together

Raise your hand if you've ever seen a bibliography like this. I looked at her and said, I'd be happy to help you format your bibliography, but, only if you promise to come back next week to learn how to improve your research.

### Failed to go beyond Shiny and new
At this point I was starting realize I had failed. I had been teaching zotero workshops for a couple of years, and on the surface, those workshops were a success. Thanks to the allure of shiny and new, timesaving technology, Zotero workshops were are most heavily attended, and people tended to leave the sessions quite happy. 

### Focused too much on the software
The problem, though, was that I was treating these workshops as a software tutorial, distinct from our more research focused classes. The sessions laboriously guided patrons through the installation process, touring the interface, going over the features and benefits of the application and demonstrating basic usage.

For many, this workshop was the only one they ever attended. They came in, learned how to automate writing a bibliography and left. But contrary to what many students would tell you, formatting a bibliography is not the most difficult part of a literature review.

### Screencasts were popular, but not with our students
I even created some screencasts, and over the time they became quite popular. The thing is they were popular outside of the Kennedy School community, by people who were looking for Zotero help. 

### Zotero as gateway drug
We wanted to reach the students who didn't even know that Zotero could help them. We shouldn't be showing them Zotero at the end of the research process as a way to save a few minutes. Zotero must become our gateway drug, opening up a larger world of library possiblities to our students.

### Introduction
My name is Luke Gaudreau, and up until a couple of months ago, I was a Research & Instruction Librarian at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. 

The Kennedy School is a graduate school in public policy, and it attracts an incredible range of talented, bright students with an extraordinarily diverse range of experience. 

### The student body
The Student body is comprised of roughly 42% international students. Within the school's 2 year programs, students average between 3-5 yrs work experience with a median age between 26 and 30. Not too different than most other grad programs...perhaps slightly older and perhaps slightly more experienced than some student populations.

But in addition, a third of the student body is made up of participants in the midcareer program. Midcareer students are required to have a minimum of 7 years work experience. The average work experience is closer to 14 years. And the median age is almost 40. So, a substantial portion of the student body hadn't been in an academic environment since 1999.

### The Internet in 1999
Think about that. Here's what the internet looked like in 1999. You had large, heavy, plastic blobs you could use to log on to AOL and look at dancing babies.

### The Library in 1999
I was an undergrad student in 1999. Sure there was a lot of information available on the internet, even then. But not many college students were using it as the basis for constructing their research habits. It was an amusement, an afterthought, a place to download mp3s. When you needed to write a paper, you went to the library. You consulted a handful of databases, something called an online catalog and maybe even dusted off a volume or two of reader's guide.

### Today, the library is an afterthought
But now, today. Today it's the library that is an afterthought. The pace of innovation on the internet has far outstripped that of libraries. It's just too damn easy to use Google. And so that's where everyone starts. I mean everyone. Students. Me. You. Faculty.

Back to our student with the very limited list of sources. She did most of her research in Google because it was easy to use. And because the library tools were not. Or worse, they were not even on her radar. How could we reach her earlier? How could we convince her that beyond tools like Zotero, the library had a lot to offer to help her in her academic career?


### MAGIC

The answer is magic. As I've mentioned, students always left the room quite happy after learning about Zotero. They had discovered something that was going to save them time and effort, and it was going to do it magically. Students leaving these classes would often tell their friends about Zotero, and how cool it was and how it would save them time. 

There was something magical about seeing Zotero at work. It made you want to tell other people about it. And when you think about it, librarians know all kinds of magic tricks. So we decided to put on a show.

### Fall Orientation
Our new student orientation sessions every fall probably look similar to those that any of you might give at your school. We introduce students to the Harvard Library, tell them about the 70 plus separate libraries we have on campus, show them the catalog, and maybe a few databases. We might answer a few questions about borrowing books, or interlibrary loan. We had mentioned Zotero before, but this past Fall we showed them the magic.

Instead of boring our students to death with a list of facts, pointers to various systems and search boxes, catalogs and jargon, we showed them technique. 

### Sample assignment, start with google scholar

We showed them how begin the research process with a sample assignment. 
- see if your professor has written anything on the topic for the assignemt
  - use google scholar and the catalog to find them

### Look at the citations in the paper
- check the citations in their book or paper

### Find the full text
  - use citation linker (sfx) to find the full text of some of those citations
  - start to look for share terminology, connections
- and then since we're a public policy school, we have to reach out beyond the academic literature

### Search .gov
- so we show them some google MAGIC
- many students like to think of themselves as expert googlers. 
- they're mostly wrong. and most of them had never seen most of the magic we were showing off.
- demonstrate site: specific searching

### Search .edu
- explain tlds and why you should try for a healthy mix of .com, .gov, .edu, .org

### Search .cn.gov
- demonstrate country specific and language specific search techniques
  - pause to let students furiously write down site: syntax
  - show them advanced search
  - pepper in information about Google's secret use of Boolean ANDs and truncation everywhere

### Saving to Zotero
All the while, everything is being saved into Zotero. You don't need to give alot of explanation up front, just say what it is, wave your hands, and say we'll come back to it later.

### Creating a bibliography
Then at the end of the orientation, switch to a half complete document. Demonstrate adding a citatation and creating a bibliogrpahy and BOOM

### BOOM
Oh, and by the way, please sign up for a Zotero session. Here are the dates:

### But, did it work?
Boy did it ever work. The first session? Our instruction room is pretty small. Holds 10 comfortably, 15 uncomfortably. I had to turn people away. Allowed them to sign up for an alternate session. 22 people signed up for an alternate session so...
15 + 22 = 37 People came to the first session
average ~10 per sesssion, 1-2 sessions per week for the next 6 weeks

### New problems

With so many people coming to our Zotero sessions, we had a new problem. With such a diverse student body, people were coming to us with a broad range of technical aptitude. Some students came to the workshops with Zotero installed, and already in use, and had questions for us about using it on their iPad or adding citations from more obscure sources. Other students came to the sesssion and struggled with installation. Both groups detracted from our ability to use a more holistic approach in teaching. I was spending as much as half of each hour long session, troubleshooting and answering technical questions.

So we adapted. I started asking people to install Zotero ahead of time, and began showing up 1/2 hour before the workshop to help anyone who had questions. Maintaining screencasts was getting more difficult over time, as Zotero gets updated frequently. I decided to swap it out for web pages with screenshots. That way, if something changed, I could swap it out quickly without having to edit, render and upload new videos each time. So now, I could point people to our website, and offer help before the workshop as needed.

Now, I could focus the sessions more fully on Zotero and the research process.

### Demonstrate value, establish trust
But the best part of all, showing people something really cool that saves them time upfront? They will remember you. They'll remember you because you showed them something valuable, and you established a sense of trust.
