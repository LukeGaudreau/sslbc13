### Voice mail help with Zotero
- one day last fall
- i came back from lunch
- to find my voice mail lit up
- On the other end was desparate student
- She had a paper due tomorrow 
- and she was having trouble getting all of her citations to work in zotero. 

- I asked her to come in that afternoon, 
- and I set down to help her. 
- We started by looking at the citations she had collected in Zotero. 
- it looked something like this:

### Look at citations together

How many of you have seen a bibliography like this?
- Wikipedia
- CNN
- Random Blogs
- How Stuff Works!?
- I looked at her and said, 
- I can help you format your bibliography, 
- but, you have to promise to come back next week to learn how to improve your research.

### Failed to go beyond Shiny and new
At this point I was starting realize I had failed. I had been teaching zotero workshops for a couple of years, and on the surface, those workshops were a success. Thanks to the allure of 
- shiny and new
- timesaving technology
Zotero workshops were are most heavily attended, and people tended to leave the sessions quite happy. 

### Focused too much on the software
The problem, though, was that I was treating these workshops as a software tutorial, distinct from our more research focused classes. The sessions 
- laboriously guided patrons through the installation process
- touring the interface
- going over features and benefits 
- and demonstrating basic usage.

For a lot of people, this workshop was the only one they ever attended. They came in, learned how to automate writing a bibliography and left. But contrary to what many students would tell you, formatting a bibliography isn't the most difficult part of a literature review.

### Screencasts were popular, but not with our students
I even created some screencasts, and over the time they became quite popular. 
- The problem was they were only popular outside of the Kennedy School
- on youtube, and on the zotero wiki 

### Zotero as gateway drug
We wanted to reach the students who didn't even know that Zotero could help them. 

We didn't want to show them Zotero at the end of the research process as a way to save a few minutes. 

Zotero had to become our gateway drug, opening up a larger world of library possiblities to our students.

### Introduction
- My name is Luke Gaudreau, and 
- up until a couple of months ago
- I was a Research & Instruction Librarian at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. 

- The Kennedy School is a graduate school in public policy
- it attracts an incredible range of talented, bright students with a very diverse range of experience. 

### The student body
- The Student body is comprised of roughly 42% international students. 
- Within the school's 2 year programs
- students average between 3 and 5 yrs of work experience 
- ther's a median age of between 26 and 30
- Not too different than most other grad programs...
- maybe a little older and maybe slightly more experienced than some student populations.

- But in addition, a third of the student body is made up of participants in the midcareer program. 
- Midcareer students are required to have a minimum of 7 years work experience. 
- The average work experience of those students is more like 14 years
- And the median age is nearly 40
- So, a substantial portion of the student body hadn't been in an academic environment since 1999.

### The Internet in 1999
- Think about that
- Here's what the internet looked like in 1999
- You had large, heavy, plastic blobs 
- you could use them to dial on to AOL
- and look at dancing babies.

### The Library in 1999
- I was an undergrad student in 1999
- Sure there was a lot of information available on the internet, even then
- But not many college students were using it as the basis for constructing their research habits
- It was an amusement, an afterthought, a place to download mp3s
- When you needed to write a paper, you went to the library
- You consulted a handful of databases
- something called an online catalog
- and maybe even dusted off a volume or two of reader's guide.

### Today, the library is an afterthought
- But now, today
- Today it's the library that's an afterthought
- The pace of innovation on the internet has far outstripped that of libraries. 
- It's just too damn easy to use Google
- And so that's where everyone starts
- everyone. Students. Me. You. Faculty.

- Back to our student with the very limited list of sources. 
- She did most of her research in Google because it was easy to use. 
- And because the library tools weren't
- Or worse, they weren't even on her radar
- How could we reach her earlier? 
- How could we convince her that beyond tools like Zotero, the library had a lot to offer to help her in her academic career?


### MAGIC

- The answer is magic
- As I've mentioned, students always left the room quite happy after learning about Zotero
- They had discovered something that was going to save them time and effort, and it was going to do it magically
- Students leaving these classes would often tell their friends about Zotero, 
- and how cool it was 
- and how it would save them time. 

- There was something magical about seeing Zotero at work. 
- It made you want to tell other people about it.
-  And when you think about it, librarians know all kinds of magic tricks. 
- So we decided to put on a show.

### Fall Orientation
-Our new student orientation sessions every fall probably look similar to those that any of you might give at your school.
- We introduce students to the Harvard Library
- tell them about the 70 plus separate libraries we have on campus
- show them the catalog
- and maybe a few databases. 
- We might answer a few questions about borrowing books,
- or interlibrary loan
- We had mentioned Zotero before
- but this past Fall we showed them the magic.

- Instead of boring our students to death with a list of facts
-  and pointers to various systems and search boxes, catalogs and jargon, we showed them technique. 

### Sample assignment, start with google scholar

We showed them how begin the research process with a simple assignment.
- write a basic policy analysis on carbon tax policy
- and with a joke: Harvard professors love to assign their own papers 
- so let's see if your professor has written anything on the topic
  - use google scholar and the catalog to find them
  - make note of how frequently the paper is cited

### Look at the citations in the paper
- and then, we showed them how to check the citations in their paper
- we talked about following the path of the scholars who've come before you, building on their work

### Find the full text
  - then we showed them how to find the full text of those citations, using our citation linker tool
- and then since we're a public policy school, we have to reach out beyond the academic literature

### Search .gov
- so we show them some google MAGIC
- a lot of students like to think of themselves as expert googlers. 
- they're mostly wrong. and most of them had never seen most of the magic we were showing off.
- we showed them how to use site specific searching to find content on govenrment websites

### Search .edu
- we explained top level domains and why you should try for a healthy mix of .com, .gov, .edu, .org

### Search .cn.gov
- we even demonstrate country specific and language specific search techniques
  - as students furiously write down site: syntax
  - we show them advanced search and explain that they can use this to learn the syntax over time
  - we even peppered in information about Google's secret use of Boolean ANDs and truncation everywhere
  - what we were doing was showing them the magic in something they used every day

### Saving to Zotero
All the while, everything is being saved into Zotero. 
- You don't need to give alot of explanation up front, just say what it is, wave your hands, and say we'll come back to it later.

### Creating a bibliography
Then at the end of the orientation, we switched to a half complete paper. And we demonstrated adding a citatation and creating the bibliography AND

### BOOM
Then we asked them to sign up for a workshop

### But, did it work?
- bud did it work?
- Boy did it ever work.
- The first session? 
- Our instruction room is pretty small.
- it Holds 10 comfortably, 15 uncomfortably. 
- I had to turn people away.
- we let  them to sign up for an alternate session. 
- 22 people signed up for an alternate session so...
- 37 People came to the first session
- over the next 6 weeks, we had an average ~10 people per session

### New problems

- With so many people coming to our Zotero sessions
- we had a new problem
- With such a diverse student body, people were coming to us with a broad range of technical aptitude. 

- Some students came to the workshops with Zotero installed, and already in use, 
- they had questions for us about using it on their iPad or adding citations from more obscure sources. 

- but Other students came to the sesssion and struggled with basic installation and use

- Both groups detracted from our ability to use a more holistic approach in teaching. 
- I was spending as much as half of each hour long session
- troubleshooting and answering technical questions.

- So we adapted
- I started asking people to install Zotero ahead of time
- and began showing up 1/2 hour before the workshop to help anyone who had questions. 

- Maintaining screencasts was getting more difficult over time
- Zotero gets updated frequently
- I swapped them out for web pages with screenshots. 

- Now, if something changed, I could swap it out quickly without having to edit, render and upload new videos each time.  
- so we pointed people to our website to get started
- and then help before each workshop as needed.

- now I could help them get up and running 
- or answer advanced questions
- without taking time away from the group.

Now, I could focus the sessions more fully on Zotero and the research process.

### Demonstrate value, establish trust
- But the best part of all
- showing people something really cool that saves them time upfront
- They **will** remember you
- They'll remember you because you showed them something valuable, and you established a sense of trust.
