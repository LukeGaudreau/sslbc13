Students, Faculty and Researchers have a growing need for tools to help them
discover new research and manage a complex collaborative research process. Join
us to learn best practices and discover lessons learned in teaching and
supporting research tools. Learn how you can leverage tools like Mendeley &
Zotero to build trust with your users and have them coming back for more.

One day I came back from lunch to find the VoiceMail indicator on phone lit up. On the other end was the voice a of a desparate student. She had a paper due tomorrow and she heard that Zotero could help her save time by formatting her bibliography for her. 

I arranged for her to come in that afternoon, and I set down to introduce her to Zotero. I walked her through the installation, got her setup with a sync account and gave her a quick tour of the interface. 

Then I asked her to show me her sources so we could go about adding them to Zotero. She opened her paper and showed me her list of sources. It looked something like this:

- Wikipedia
- Google
- Google
- Some Blog
- Cnn.com
- Some questionable nonprofit
- about.com
- one book

Raise your hand if you've ever seen a bibliography like this. I looked at her and said, I'd be happy to help you format your bibliography, but, only if you promise to come back next week to learn how to improve your research.

It was then that I realized, I've been teaching our students Zotero for a couple of years now and many have learned it well, but I've failed them. We shouldn't be showing them Zotero at the end of the process as a way to save a few minutes. Zotero should become our gateway drug, opening up a larger world of library possiblities to our students.

My name is Luke Gaudreau, and up until a couple of months ago, I was a Research & Instruction Librarian at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. 
The Kennedy School is a graduate school in public policy, and it attracts an incredible range of talented, bright students with an extraordinarily diverse range of experience. 

Many students start at the Kennedy School with substantial real world experience. TODO Something about median age and experince blbahblah

When I started teaching Zotero, we began with some in person workshops. The workshops went well at first. I'd get about 4 or 5 students per session, and people usually left the room quite happy, secure in the knowledge that they'd never have to format a bibliography again.

I even created some screencasts, and over the time they became quite popular. The thing is they were popular outside of the Kennedy School community, by people who were looking for Zotero help. We wanted to reach the students who didn't even know that Zotero could help them. 

Back to our student with the very limited list of sources. How could we reach her earlier in the year? How could we convince her that beyond tools like Zotero, the library had a lot to offer to help her in her acaemic career?

MAGIC

The answer is magic. As I've mentioned, students always left the room quite happy after learing about Zotero. They had discovered something that was going to save them time and effort, and it was going to do it magically. Students leaving these classes would often tell their friends about Zotero, and how cool it was and how it would save them time. 

There was something magical about seeing Zotero at work. It made you want to tell other people about it. And so we decided to do a little magic show during orientation this past fall.

Our orientation sessions probably look similar to those that any of you might give at your school. We introduce students to the Harvard Library, tell them about the 70 plus libraries we have on campus, show them the catalog, and maybe a few databases. We might answer a few questions about borrowing books, or interlibrary loan. We had mentioned Zotero before, but this past Fall we showed them the magic.

Instead of boring our students to death with a list of facts, pointers to various systems and search boxes, catalogs and jargon, we showed them technique

NOT WHAT, but HOW

We showed them how begin the research process with a sample assignment. 
- see if your professor has written anything on the topic for the assignemt
  - use google scholar and the catalog to find them
- check the citations in their book or paper
  - use citation linker (sfx) to find the full text of some of those citations
  - lather rinse repeat
- use GOOGLE MAGIC to find gov, nonprofit, foreign websites dealing with your topic
  - pause to let students furiously write down site: syntax
  - show them advanced search
  
All the while, everything is being saved into Zotero. You don't need to give alot of explanation up front, just say what it is, and we'll come back to it later.

Then at the end of the orientation, switch to a half complete document. Demonstrate adding a citatation and creating a bibliogrpahy and BOOM
<SILENCE>

Oh, and by the way, please sign up for a Zotero session. Here are the dates:

BUT, DID IT WORK?

Boy did it ever work. The first session? Our instruction room is pretty small. Holds 10 comfortably, 15 uncomfortably. I had to turn people away. Allowed them to sign up for an alternate session. 22 people signed up for an alternate session so...
15 + 22 = 37 People came to the first session
average ~10 per sesssion, 1-2 sessions per week for the next 6 weeks

WE REACHED A LOT OF PEOPLE

But the best part of all, showing people something really cool that saves them time upfront? They will remember you.
They'll remember your face, and your name, and they'll be back again.

LESSONS LEARNED
- get a bigger room
- updating screencasts is a pain
- installation gets complicated
  - require people to install ahead of time
  - 1 hour session
  - show up 1/2 hour early to help anyone who's had troubel with installation
    - extra 1/2 hour saved SOO MUCH TIME
  - get used to different configurations
    - foreign languages
    - visual memory
